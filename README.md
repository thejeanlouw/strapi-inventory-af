# ðŸš€ Getting started with Azure and Supabase

### Step 1: Create Azure Resources
- Log in to the Azure Portal and create a new Resource Group to contain your Strapi resources.
- Create an App Service to host the Strapi web application:
- Choose Code publish, Node 18 LTS runtime stack, Linux OS
- Select an appropriate region and App Service Plan
- Link to Github repo for deployment

### Step 2: Configure App 
- In the Configuration section of the App Service, set WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION to "~18".
- On the General Settings tab, update the platform to "64 bit" to allow the "sharp" package used by Strapi to run.
- Configure Application Settings with the required environment variables (database.ts)

### Step 3: Setup and Deploy Strapi
- Clone the Strapi repository to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- Run `npm run build` to build the admin panel.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the Strapi server.
- Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:1337/admin to access the Strapi admin panel.
- Create a new user and configure the required content types.
- Commit your changes and push to the main branch of your Github repository.
- In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Deployment Center of your App Service and select Github as the source.
- Choose the repository and branch to deploy from and click Save.
- The deployment process will start automatically, and you can monitor the progress in the Deployment Center.
- Once the deployment is complete, you can access your Strapi application by navigating to the URL of your App Service.

### Step 4: Test the API
curl --location 'http://localhost:1337/api/products' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer facf255edf60059742a6d26510ab6f510785d03374924a5592efc2871e4a2b0485bda6fef8efd9855c96c9f09d84a14608fde0ef023f130780ce84cb2f663833109f6ec9a4e44f9bfd6e612eef7d1e35e1549abe0d3493c2f2b7b0be3b5cc79bafa08f551cc3ac1b02a175309b70e7b20f92e21235c021849b629eef4b2b258a'
