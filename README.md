# üöÄ Getting started with Azure and Supabase

### Step 1: Create Azure Resources
- Log in to the Azure Portal and create a new Resource Group to contain your Strapi resources.
- Create an App Service to host the Strapi web application:
- Choose Code publish, Node 18 LTS runtime stack, Linux OS
- Select an appropriate region and App Service Plan
- Link to Github repo for deployment

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase
- Go to supabase.com and sign up for a new project.
- In your Supabase project, go to the SQL Editor and create a new table called "devices" with columns:
    ```sql
    id (int8, primary key)
    name (text)
    price (float8)
    description (text)
    created_at (timestamp)
    updated_at (timestamp)
    ```
- In the Authentication section, enable email/password sign-in.
- Note down your Supabase project URL and anon/service_role API keys for the next steps.

### Step 3: Configure App Service
- In the Configuration section of the App Service, set WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION to "~18".
- On the General Settings tab, update the platform to "64 bit" to allow the "sharp" package used by Strapi to run.
- Configure Application Settings with the required environment variables:
    ```plaintext
    HOST: 0.0.0.0
    PORT: 1337
    DATABASE_URL: your Supabase DB connection string
    SUPABASE_URL: your Supabase project URL
    SUPABASE_KEY: your Supabase anon API key
    ```
